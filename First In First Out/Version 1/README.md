# First In First Out Protocol (Version 1)

    This version supports 4 turtlebot3 robots participating in an intersection from different angle.

This is the first step towarding negotiation for autonomous driving. The ***centralize*** will control the traffic flow as the vehicles entered the intersection. Whoever entered the intersection first will pass, while others wait for the signal coming from the ***centralize***.
